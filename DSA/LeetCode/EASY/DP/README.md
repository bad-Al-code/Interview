# Dynamic Programming

- used to solve problems with overlapping subproblems and optional substructure.

### Top Down with Memoization

- store the results of subproblems in an array or hashmap to avoid redundant calculations.

### Bottom Up with Tabulation

- use an array to solve problems iteratively, storing results of subproblems as you go.

### When use DP?

- **Overlapping subproblems**: results from smaller subproblems help solve larger ones.
- **Optimal Substructures**: final solution is constructed from the optimmal solution of
  subproblems.
