/**
 * When use window sliding pattern?
 * - repeated computations on a contiguous set of data elements.
 * - when window moves, it takes O(1) or slower growing function for computations.
 *
 * When do not use window sliding pattern?
 * - input data structure does not support random access.
 * - process the entire array without segmentation.
