# Graph

- set of nodes that are connected to each other in the form of a network.

##### Vertex

- collection of vertex forms a graph. { similar to linked list }.

##### Edge

- link between two vertices.
- can be uni-directional or bi-directional; depends on graph.

### Terminologies

1. **Degree of Vertex**: total number of edes connected to a vertex. {InDegree: number of incoming edges, OUTDEGREE:
   outgoing edges }.
2. **Parallel Edges**: Two undirected edges are parallelâ€‹ if they have the same end vertices. Two directed edges are parallel if they have the same origin and destination.

3. **Self Loop**: This occurs when an edge starts and ends on the same vertex.

4. **Adjacency**: Two vertices are said to be adjacent if there is an edge connecting them directly.

### Types

1. **Undirected Graph**

- are edges are undirected; no notion of direction to the edges.

2. **Directed Graph**

- edges are uni-directional.
- For a directed graph with n vertices, the minimum number of edges that can connect a vertex with every other vertex is n-1. This excludes self-loops.

### Representations

1. **Adjacency Matrix**

- 2D matrix where each cell can contain a 0 or 1.
- If a cell contains 1, there exists an edge between the corresponding vertices e.g., Matrix[0][1]=1Matrix[0][1]=1 shows that an edge exists between vertex 0 and 1.
- For a directed graph, the usual convention is to think of the rows as sources and the columns as destinations.

2. **Adjacency List**

- array of linked list is used to store all the edges in the graph.
- size of array === number f vertices.
